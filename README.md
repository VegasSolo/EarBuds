# SE-Project

We will be designing a music referral site that doubles as social media. It will be web based that allows users
to create accounts using a username and password that will be used to favorite certain musical groups. From there, 
users will be able to view artists similar to the ones liked and other artists which are favorited by other users who 
share the same likes. Users will be able to filter certain groups by disliking them, or even disliking a genre entirely. 
There will be a search function that will search by artists, genre, or even by songs. Upon finding a musical group that 
a user likes, they will be able to open the artist page and find miscellaneous information about them as well as external 
links. All of the user account information will be stored as well as the entire musical group database. Users will be able
to also create playlists of music using Spotify API available on their profiles. Their profiles will be able to be moderately 
customized by creating a playlist and decorating with favorited artists. Users will also be able to create a friends list and be 
able to search for users and view their profiles. A mobile app will be attempted to be designed as a feature of our software.
