# To Do List. If you are working on a task, place your name in front of it. Do not push to master until it is complete. #

- Fix formatting & presentation (especially on artist.ejs page)
- Set the index.ejs search bar search function so that when it transfers to artist.ejs page it should auto-populate that search bar w/ what was in index's search
- (Optional) Add typeahead functionality to artist.ejs
- Add MANY more artists into artist.sql database (hundreds)
- [Osvaldo] Spotify ACCOUNT integration (this should allow us to use Facebook integration and such through them as well)
- Add playlist capability
- When signed in, the user can search from their profile page that returns MORE than just 30 second preview albums (but rather full songs)
- Add friends list in user accounts database to keep track of user id's that they are friends with
- Add a 'like' button to each artist (ONLY the artists that are stored in artist.sql database)
- Update user profile page to look cleaner (hide some of the useless information)
- Add to user profile page a area that displays what artists they like and another area for friends
- [Dillon] Add recommendation engine option for each artist (example code exists -- Dillon has it, ask him)
- Menu bar for navigation
- Bar on bottom that shows where you are in the song (like Soundcloud)
