# To Do List. If you are working on a task, place your name in front of it. Do not push to master until it is complete. #

- Add playlist capability
- When signed in, the user can search from their profile page that returns MORE than just 30 second preview albums (but rather full songs)
- Add recommendation engine option for each artist
- Bar on bottom that shows where you are in the song (like Soundcloud)


FINAL ITERATION
- menu bar (control bar on bottom, could be dummy for artist/song playing)
- links to artists and users at favorite location (instead of strings)
- full playback and playlist (w/ spotify) [taylor said this would be a plus]
